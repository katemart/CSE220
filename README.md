# CSE220
various projects written in assembly (MIPS)

proj1 - basic operations in MIPS, including but not limited to loops, if-statements, and bitwise operations. Implementation includes validation of command-line arguments, interpreting R-type instructions, floating-point conversions, and identifying basic poker hands.

proj2 - non-trivial algorithms using functions in MIPS. Implementation includes various types of encryption and decryption such as basic substitution cipher, bifid cipher, and base64.

proj3 - non-trivial algorithms using functions, structs, and 2D arrays in MIPS. Implements a collection of functions to simulate a basic (text-based) version of the popular game of Tetris.

proj4 - non-trivial algorithms using functions, structs, 2D arrays, and queues in MIPS. Implements a collection of functions to simulate the “packetizing” and reassembly of a message transmitted through a network.
